### Helps You Be a Better Developer

Adopting Conventional Commits improves your communication skills by encouraging clear and organized commit messages. It helps you focus on your changes and their impact, making it easier to manage projects and collaborate effectively.


## üöÄ How to Use Conventional Commits in Your Git Workflow

### 1. **Commit Messages Using `git commit` in the Terminal**

When you make changes to your code and want to commit them using **Conventional Commits**, you'll use the `git commit` command in your terminal. The key is to follow the **Conventional Commit** format for your commit messages.

#### Example Command:
In your terminal, run the following:


git commit -m "feat(auth): add Google login feature"

## Steps to Commit in the Terminal

1. **Make Changes**: Modify your files as needed.

2. **Stage Your Changes**: Add your modified files to the staging area.
    git add <file>
    Or to add all changed files at once:
    git add .

3. **Commit with Conventional Commit Message**: After staging the changes, use the following command to commit:
    git commit -m "feat(button): add rounded corners"

4. **Push the Changes**: Push your commits to the remote repository.
    git push
    Or if you are pushing to a specific branch:
    git push origin <branch-name>



## üöÄ Basic Structure

Each commit message follows this structure:

- **type**: Describes the change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`)
- **scope**: Optional. Refers to the area of the project being affected (e.g., `api`, `frontend`)
- **description**: A short description of the change.

## üìã Types of Commit

1. **feat**: A new feature for the user or system  
   Example: `feat(auth): add Google login feature`

2. **fix**: A bug fix for the user or system  
   Example: `fix(button): resolve issue with button hover state`

3. **chore**: Routine tasks like maintenance or updating dependencies  
   Example: `chore(deps): update react to version 17.0.2`

4. **docs**: Documentation updates  
   Example: `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

5. **style**: Changes related to code style (e.g., formatting, missing semi-colons)  
   Example: `style(button): fix button alignment in CSS`

6. **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature  
   Example: `refactor(auth): simplify login form validation logic`

7. **test**: Adding or updating tests  
   Example: `test(auth): add unit tests for login function`

8. **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies  
   Example: `build(webpack): add webpack config for production build`

9. **ci**: Continuous integration-related changes  
   Example: `ci(gitlab): update CI config for deployment pipeline`

10. **perf**: Code changes that improve performance
   Example: `perf(api): optimize database queries for faster responses`

11. **env**: Changes related to environment setup or configuration 
    Example: `env(docker): update Dockerfile for staging environment`

12. **sec**: Security fixes or improvements
    Example: `sec(auth): add encryption for user passwords`



### Initialize the Local Repository
1. **Navigate to your desired directory** (if not already in `cheatSheet`):
   ```bash
   cd cheatSheet
   ```

2. **Initialize the directory as a Git repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

---

### Clone the Repository (Preferred Method)
Instead of pulling directly, clone the repository to ensure a clean setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasanth76200/conventional-commit-cheatsheet.git
```

This will create a new directory named `conventional-commit-cheatsheet` with the repository's content. If you want it cloned into the `cheatSheet` directory:

1. **Go to the parent directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Clone into `cheatSheet`**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasanth76200/conventional-commit-cheatsheet.git cheatSheet
   ```

---

### Pull Changes After Initialization
If you‚Äôve already initialized `cheatSheet` as a Git repository:

1. **Add the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/prasanth76200/conventional-commit-cheatsheet.git
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

---

### Verify
After completing these steps, verify the setup:
```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see the remote repository listed.

Let me know if you encounter any issues!
   Example: `perf(api): optimize database queries for faster responses`
