### Helps You Be a Better Developer

Adopting Conventional Commits improves your communication skills by encouraging clear and organized commit messages. It helps you focus on your changes and their impact, making it easier to manage projects and collaborate effectively.


## üöÄ How to Use Conventional Commits in Your Git Workflow

### 1. **Commit Messages Using `git commit` in the Terminal**

When you make changes to your code and want to commit them using **Conventional Commits**, you'll use the `git commit` command in your terminal. The key is to follow the **Conventional Commit** format for your commit messages.

#### Example Command:
In your terminal, run the following:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add Google login feature"

## Steps to Commit in the Terminal

1. **Make Changes**: Modify your files as needed.

2. **Stage Your Changes**: Add your modified files to the staging area.
    ```bash
    git add <file>
    ```
    Or to add all changed files at once:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3. **Commit with Conventional Commit Message**: After staging the changes, use the following command to commit:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat(button): add rounded corners"
    ```

4. **Push the Changes**: Push your commits to the remote repository.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
    Or if you are pushing to a specific branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```


## üöÄ Basic Structure

Each commit message follows this structure:

- **type**: Describes the change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`)
- **scope**: Optional. Refers to the area of the project being affected (e.g., `api`, `frontend`)
- **description**: A short description of the change.
